Feature: Manage user access for each assignment
  As an instructor
  So that I can manage a userâ€™s permissions for each assignment
  I want to add a read, write, and no access privilege checkbox for each assignment under a user

  Background:
    Given the following assignments exist:
      | repository_name   |
      | assignment-1-repo |
      | assignment-2-repo |
      | assignment-3-repo |
    And the following users exist in assignment permissions:
      | name     | role       | assignment1_access | assignment2_access | assignment3_access |
      | alice    | ta         | read               | read               | no-access          |
      | bob      | ta         | read-write         | read-write         | read-write         |
      | charlie  | instructor | read-write         | read-write         | read-write         |
    And I am logged in to view assignment permissions as "charlie"
    And I am on the "Manage Users" page for assignment permissions
